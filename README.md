# Phishing Email Detector
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
An AI tool that identifies phishing emails in real-time to protect users from cyber attacks. Building AI course project.

## Background
* Problem: Many users fall victim to phishing emails, risking sensitive information.
* Frequency: Millions of phishing emails are sent daily.
* Motivation: Protect people from cybercrime using AI.

## How it is used?
* Users: Individuals or companies checking emails.
* Context: The AI scans incoming emails and flags phishing attempts.
* Implementation: Can be integrated as an email filter or browser plugin.

## Data sources and AI methods
* Data: Public phishing email dataset from Kaggle.
* AI Techniques:
  * Text preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization
  * Classification: Logistic Regression or Neural Networks
  * Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

## Challenges
* Cannot catch 100% of phishing attempts.
* False positives may mark safe emails as phishing.
* Needs continuous retraining with new phishing patterns.
* Ethical concerns: Avoid flagging legitimate emails incorrectly.

## What next?
* Improve with deep learning models (RNNs or Transformers).
* Add multilingual phishing detection.
* Collaborate with cybersecurity experts for real-world deployment.

## Acknowledgments
* Phishing Email Dataset on Kaggle
* Inspired by public AI email classification projects.
